### ⚠️ Note
In some lessons you will be using Firebase & MongoDB as database so that you can make API requests.

You will need to create Firebase project and import provided `learning-next-firebase.json` file in realtime database.

You will also need to create MongoDB database and import provided `learning-next-mongodb.json` file.

Then, in lessons where you see `.env.example` file, create `.env` file at the root of the project and:
- to a variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` assign your Firebase key
- to a variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABASE` assign you MongoDB connection string
